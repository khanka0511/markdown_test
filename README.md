# MathVec ðŸ§®
Math library built with Typescript 

Typescript tool for implementing math equations for your app

## Setup
- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/zolbooo/mathvec.git`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run: 
```
       npm run-script build
       npm run-script dev
```
- To run test cases built within the repository: `npm test`

## Usage

/** Add two vectors. Returns new vector. 
```
  add(b: Vector): Vector;
```
Subtract two vectors. Returns new vector. 
```
  sub(b: Vector): Vector;
```
Multiply vector by scalar. Returns new vector.
``` 
  mul(b: number): Vector;
```
Find dot product of two vectors. 
```
  dot(b: Vector): number;
```
Find angle between two vectors. 
```
  angle(b: Vector): ReturnType<typeof Angle>;
```
Create new vector with opposite direction with same length. 
```
  neg(): Vector;
```
Check if two vectors are equal. 
```
  equal(v2: Vector): boolean;
```  

Calculate vector between two points 
```
  to(p2: TPoint): Vector;
```
Get middle of two points 
```
  mid(p2: TPoint): TPoint;
```  
Apply vector transformation on point 
```
  apply(vec: Vector): TPoint;
```
Check if two points are equal. 
```
  equal(p2: TPoint): boolean;
```

**Directional comments are written in the code which you can implement them to your app.
You can also add a little spice and use them for Figma, Adobe XD as a plugin.**
