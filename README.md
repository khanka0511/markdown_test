# MathVec ðŸ§®
Math library built with Typescript 

Typescript tool for implementing math equations for your app

## Setup 
- Install `npm install mathvec`

## Usage

- Import `import { Vec, Point } from 'mathvec';`

#### Function Vec creates new Vector instance which has following methods:
- Add two vectors. Returns new vector. 
```
  add(b: Vector): Vector;
```
- Subtract two vectors. Returns new vector. */
```
  sub(b: Vector): Vector;
```
- Multiply vector by scalar. Returns new vector. 
```
  mul(b: number): Vector;
```
- Find dot product of two vectors. 
```
  dot(b: Vector): number;
```
- Find angle between two vectors. 
```
  angle(b: Vector): ReturnType<typeof Angle>;
```
- Create new vector with opposite direction with same length. 
```
  neg(): Vector;
```
- Check if two vectors are equal. 
```
  equal(v2: Vector): boolean;
```
For example:
```
  const a = Vec(1, -4, 3);
  const b = Vec(9, 4, 2);
  a.add(b); // Vec(10, 0, 5)
```

#### Function Point creates new TPoint instance. TPoint has following methods:
- Calculate vector between two points 
```
  to(p2: TPoint): Vector;
```
- Get middle of two points 
```
  mid(p2: TPoint): TPoint;
```
- Apply vector transformation on point 
```
  apply(vec: Vector): TPoint;
```
- Check if two points are equal. 
```
  equal(p2: TPoint): boolean; 
```
For example: 
```
  const a = Point(1, 1, 1);
  const b = Point(3, 3, 3);
  a.mid(b); //mid(2, 2, 2);
```

## Setup for development

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run: 
```
       npm run-script build
       npm run-script dev
```
- To run test cases built within the repository: `npm test`
